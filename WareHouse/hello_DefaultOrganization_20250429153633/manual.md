# Say Hi Application

A simple Python application that greets users with a friendly "Hi!" through a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.

## Main Functions

- **Greeting Button**: The application features a button labeled "Say Hi". When clicked, it displays a message box with the greeting "Hi!".
- **Exit Confirmation**: The application prompts the user with a confirmation dialog when attempting to close the window, ensuring that accidental exits are avoided.

## Installation of Environment Dependencies

To run the "Say Hi" application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, the Tkinter library is included with most Python installations, but if you encounter any issues, you may need to install it separately.

### Steps to Install Python and Tkinter

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   
2. **Verify Tkinter Installation**: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to check if Tkinter is installed:
   ```bash
   python -m tkinter
   ```
   If a small window appears, Tkinter is installed correctly.

3. **Install Additional Dependencies** (if necessary):
   If you need to install Tkinter separately (mostly for Linux users), you can do so using the package manager:
   - For Ubuntu/Debian:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install python3-tk
     ```
   - For Fedora:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
     ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Download the Code**: Clone or download the repository containing the `main.py` file.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.

3. **Run the Application**: Execute the following command to run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Interact with the GUI**:
   - Once the application window opens, you will see a welcome message and a button labeled "Say Hi".
   - Click the "Say Hi" button to see the greeting message box pop up.
   - To exit the application, click the close button on the window. A confirmation dialog will appear asking if you really want to quit. Click "OK" to exit or "Cancel" to return to the application.

## Conclusion

The "Say Hi" application is a simple yet effective demonstration of using Python and Tkinter to create a GUI application. Feel free to modify the code to add more features or customize the greetings!
